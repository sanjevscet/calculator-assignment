# Calculator Assignment

Hi! I'm using **Laravel** 7.18 version as this is available by default. PHP version is 7.2.*.

**Heroku** is used here for hosting that assignment.

**Public URL** https://majestic-kobuk-valley-80314.herokuapp.com/

**CMD for executing Test** php artisan test


# Test Cases

I wrote the test cases for both Calculator & Store User value feature.  I implemented the **Unit** test as well as **Feature**Testing.

## Note 
I am sending **Postman** collection via Mail
Since in the document, no user authentication system is mentioned so I am not saving the user value on the basis of user authentication.

If you want that value should be used on the basis of logged in user, please let me know, I will do that.
